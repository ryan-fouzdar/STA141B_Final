The real estate market is a constantly changing sector that can be affected by economic conditions. demographic trends, investment trends, and infrastructure projects. Since there is wide variety of factors, it could be useful to look into each of these trends and figure out how each of these could change the future of the Davis real estate market. \n","\n","To help focus our search, we focus on those key 4 traits for our project. We chose to assess economic indicators because it will be useful to see how certain indicators such as unemployment rates, job growth, and GDP trends can impact the buying or selling of houses. We can also see if our predictions for the data holds true that there is correlations between these trends and one impacts the other.\n","\n","We also chose to focus on demographic trends as people from certain demographics may be more inclined to buy a house in Davis. This could be useful to real estate agents as they can target their advertisements to people of a similar demographic so they can maximize their selling capabilites.\n","\n","\n","## You can finish the rest of the introduction with your questions\n","We also chose to focus on \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","##\n","\n","Thus, we boil our report down to 4 main qeustions to focus on which are:\n","\n","Questions of Interest: \n","\n","1) How do local economic indicators, such as unemployment rates, job growth, GDP growth, and interest rates, impact the performance of the property market?\n","\n","2) Are there any demographic shifts occurring in the area that might affect property values in the near future?\n","\n","3) If I were to invest in such a property, what do we expect it to cost in the next X years?\n","\n","4) Is the market experiencing growth, stability, or decline?\n","And are there any upcoming developments or infrastructure projects that could affect property values?\n","\n","With our project, we dive deep into each of these questions and report data in nice tables and charts that readers can view and understand. \n","\n","\n","**Introduction:**\n","\n","\n","1. **Market Trends and Stability:** We aim to assess the current state of the real estate market by determining whether it is experiencing growth, stability, or decline. By analyzing historical data on property prices, transaction volumes, and market indicators, we seek to provide insights into the overall trajectory of the market and identify any underlying trends or patterns.\n","\n","2. **Impact of Infrastructure Projects:** We investigate the potential influence of upcoming developments or infrastructure projects on property values. By examining planned infrastructure initiatives, such as transportation networks, urban redevelopment projects, or commercial developments, we aim to gauge their anticipated effects on local property markets and identify investment opportunities or risks associated with these developments.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Background Information:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Methods used:\n","\n","## What methods we use in the code, importation statements, what time of webscrapping for each question\n","\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Question 1) How do local economic indicators, such as unemployment rates, job growth, GDP growth, and interest rates, impact the performance of the property market?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Webscrapping part for question 1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Visualization part for question 2"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Analysis of Question 1:"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Question 2) Are there any demographic shifts occurring in the Davis area that might affect property values in the near future?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Analysis of Question 2:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Webscrapping part for question 2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Data Visualization part for question 2"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Analysis of Question 3:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#WebScrapping for q3"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#DataVis for q3"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Analysis of Question 4:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Webscraping for q4"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#DataVis for q4"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.4"},"orig_nbformat":4,"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"aee8b7b246df8f9039afb4144a1f6fd8d2ca17a180786b69acc140d282b71a49"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
